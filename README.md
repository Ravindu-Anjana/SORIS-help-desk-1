### Online Help Desk For University Students


## 1.	Introduction

We are 1st year 2nd semester students following the internet and web technologies (IWT) course. Our project title is “Online helpdesk for university students”.

We will create a web application for SORIS university's online helpdesk. The application will aim to provide a fast and simple communication avenue for students to contact staff regarding their issues and providing staff a simple and efficient interface to respond to the students.

Our online help desk will provide several advantages for university staff and students. It will be an avenue to solve both academic and non-academic issues. Shifting to an online service will be more efficient and reliable. students will be able to inform their issues without a physical presence on campus. Students will be able to submit their inquiries at any time without a queue. Users will have better data security and privacy. This platform will foster a better relationship between staff and students.  

There will 2 user types. Students enrolled in the university and the university staff/support service provider. Students will need to register on the website. Students will be verified using a university email. Each section of the university staff will be provided a separate dashboard. Staff users will have access to relevant dashboards to handle the inquiries.
Students will be able to submit an inquiry to the relevant section. The inquiry will be open until either student or staff report it solved. Each inquiry will have a relevant inquiry id. The replies to the inquiry and closing of the inquiry will be posted to the website. Every step will also be emailed to the student with the relevant inquiry id.
Closed inquiries will be marked and archived. Students will have the ability to browse the archived inquiries.
Staff users will see relevant active inquiries in their dashboards. They will have the ability to forward the inquiries between different dashboards.
FAQ will be displayed on the site so students can browse them to solve their problems. Information about university facilities and news about important events will be provided on the site.
